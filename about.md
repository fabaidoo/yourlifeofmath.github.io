A high school math teacher once described his calculus class -- with all its trickeries and the ways in which it drew on things learned before -- as "your life of math." But the life of math goes well beyond that class. Any time something that stretches the mathematical mind comes up, that is the life of math.

Brainteasers, integrals, probability calculations, interesting math facts, proofs, economics, statistics, physics, computer science, algorithms, chess problems, big mafia plays. These are all part of your life of math.
