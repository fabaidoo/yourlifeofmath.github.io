From the 2017 Putnam:

### Q:
Suppose that a positive integer $$N$$ can be expressed as the sum of $$k$$ consecutive positive integers:

\\[ N = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+k) \\]

for $$k = 2017$$ but for no other values of $$k \gt 1$$. Considering all positive integers $$N$$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $$a$$ that occurs in any of these expressions?

### A:
First, we want to write an arbitrary $N$ more concisely:
\\[ N = ka + \frac{(k)(k-1)}{2} \\]

Notice that for odd $$k$$, $$\frac{k-1}{2}$$ is an integer, so:

\\[ N = k(a + \frac{k-1}{2}) \\]

Thus, for $$k = 2017$$, we should have that any $$N$$ is a multiple of $$2017$$.

These are just preliminary observations. But the next step took some time -- did I want to think about the problem in terms of $k$, $N$, or $a$? At first, $N$ made sense, because I thought it would be possible to write $N$ as $2017x$, but that didn't really get me anywhere. It did help in thinking about the problem and playing around with how things worked, but it turns out there is actually a quite logical approach, based on considering each $k$ and iterating through all the values of $a$ to reach the possible values of $N$ obtainable from each $k$.

First off, we observe that, if $k=2$, then we can have values of $3, 5, 7, \dots$ by setting $a = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. This immediately tells us that any value of $N$ must be even to meet the criteria of having no solution to the equation in the problem statement save for $k=2017$. We will call this criteria *invalid*, and the opposite of that *valid*. If we consider even numbers greater than $2$, we see that the values of $N$ that become invalid are a subset of those made invalid by $k=2$, as any odd $k$ will give odd values of $N$, which are all invalid already.

If we at $k=3$, we get values of $6, 9, 12, \dots$, which are clearly just the multiples of $3$ after a certain number (each time you increment $a$, you increment $N$ by $ka$). This goes on for all odd numbers, given that:

\\[ N = ka + \frac{(k)(k-1)}{2} = k(a + \frac{k-1}{2}) \\]

for $a = 1, 2, 3, \dots$

So, for all odd $k$, multiples of $k$ higher than $k(1 +\frac{k-1}{2})$ are all invalid. In fact, for composite numbers, invalid $N$ will have already been invalidated by an earlier odd prime, so we really only need to concern ourselves with primes.

So, how do we choose a valid $N$? I offer now a quick digression into something that I had thought of initially, although it was wrong. Multiples of $2017$ are good place to start, and perhaps we could multiply $2017$ by another large prime, $p$, such that:

\\[ N = 2017p \lt p(1 + \frac{p-1}{2}) \\]

and

\\[ 2017p \gt 2017(1 + \frac{2017-1}{2}) \\]

This basically ensures that the multiples of $p$ that are invalid start after our chosen $N = 2017p$, but remain valid because they come before the cutoff for $k=2017$. While this should in principle work, it doesn't give the smallest value of a possible, and the reason is this. We still haven't checked many smaller values of $N$ that are valid, specifically the even numbers. For some reason, I skipped over this thinking about it the first time -- mainly because at one point I thought that even values of $k$ would invalidate even $N$ (which is not true, because the equation for $N$ only lets you factor out $k$ for $k$ *odd*).

If we consider even values, the ones that aren't invalidated also have to avoid being multiples of $3, 5, 7$, and all the other odd primes. In that case, only values that are of the form $2^x \times 2017$ are valid. Thus, we can just set:

\\[ 2^x \times 2017 = 2017 (\frac{2017-1}{2} + a) \\]

\\[ 2^x = 1008 + a \\]

This final equation gives us, by the simple fact that $1024$ is a power of $2$, $a = 16$.
