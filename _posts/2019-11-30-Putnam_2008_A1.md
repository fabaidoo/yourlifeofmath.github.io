Let $$f : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ be a function such that $$f(x, y)+ f(y,z)+ f(z, x) = 0 $$ for all real numbers $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$. Prove that there exists a function  $$g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ such that $$f(x, y) = g(x)?g(y)$$ for all real numbers $$x$$ and $$y$$.

#### Proof:

We start with:
\\[f(x, y)+ f(y,z)+ f(z, x) = 0\\]

Then we let $$x = y = z$$, and we have:
\\[f(x,x) + f(x,x)+ f(x,x) = 3f(x,x) = 0\\]
\\[f(x,x) = 0\\]

Next, we let $$x = z$$:
\\[f(x, y)+ f(y,x)+ f(x, x) = 0\\]
\\[f(x, y)+ f(y,x) = 0\\]
\\[f(x, y) = -f(y,x)\\]

Rewriting our original equation:
\\[f(x, y) = -f(z,x) - f(y,z)\\]
\\[f(x, y) = f(x,z) - f(y,z)\\]

Finally, we simply define $g$:
\\[g(x) = f(x,z)\\]
