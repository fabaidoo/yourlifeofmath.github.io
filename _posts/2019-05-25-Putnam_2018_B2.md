### Q:

Let $$n$$ be a positive integer and let

\\[ f_n(z) = n + (n-1)z + (n-2)z^2 + \cdots + z^{n-1} \\]

Prove that $$f_n$$ has no roots on the closed unit disk $$ \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \lvert z \rvert \leq 1 \} $$. 

### A:

Personally I think my solution is a bit underwhelming. The problem statement seems to be taunting us to do some complex roots of unity magic, but I managed to bypass all of that, which is disappointing.

#### Remark 1

$$f_n$$ satisfies the following recurrence relation:

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) = n + 1 + zf_n(z) \\]

This is obtained by some simple rearrangements of the $$f_{n+1}$$ formula:

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) = n+1 + nz + (n-1)z^2 + \cdots + 2z^{n-1} + z^n \\]

\\[ = n+1 + z \left[ n + (n-1)z + \cdots + 2z^{n-2} + z^{n-1} \right] \\]

\\[ = n+1 + zf_n(z)\\]

#### Remark 2

Secondly, we note that for all $$z$$, the difference between successive pairs of functions is

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) - f_n(z) = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots + z^n \\]

This is the result of simply subtracting corresponding terms in $$f_{n+1}$$ and $$f_n$$, and is, as the intro comments, highly suggestive of roots of unity.

#### Remark 3

However, we won't need to consider any zeros of the above function. Instead, we just note that for $$z$$ in the closed unit disk,

\\[ 1 + z + z^2 + \cdots + z^n = n+1 \\]

if and only if $$z = 1$$.

#### Proof Remark 3:

The backward direction of the iff is obvious, since if we plug in $$z = 1$$, the series will clearly sum to $$n+1$$.

For the forward direction, suppose $$z$$ satisfies $$1 + z + z^2 + \cdots + z^n = n+1$$. 

We note that since $$z$$ is in the closed unit disk, we have $$ \lvert z \rvert \leq 1 $$. This implies that each of $$\lvert z \rvert$$, $$\lvert z^2 \rvert$$, ..., $$\lvert z^n \rvert$$ is $$ \leq 1$$.

If we take the real component of both sides of the equation, we have

\\[ n+1 = \operatorname{Re}(n+1) = \operatorname{Re}(1 + z + z^2 + \cdots + z^n) = \operatorname{Re}(1) + \operatorname{Re}(z) + \operatorname{Re}(z^2) + \cdots + \operatorname{Re}(z^n) \\]

Here we note that on the LHS, we have $$n+1$$, and on the RHS we have the sum of $$n+1$$ terms with each term having absolute value $$\leq 1$$. Thus for the equality to hold, we need every term on the RHS to have value $$1$$, i.e.

\\[ \operatorname{Re}(z) = \operatorname{Re}(z^2) = \cdots = \operatorname{Re}(z^n) = 1 \\]

and the facts that $$\lvert z \rvert \leq 1$$ and $$\operatorname{Re}(z) = 1$$ immediately imply that $$z = 1$$.

#### Solving the Problem

Suppose (for contradiction) that the complex number $$z$$ satisfies $$\lvert z \rvert \leq 1$$ and $$f_n(z) = 0$$.

From Remark 1, we have

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) = n+1 + zf_n(z) = n+1 \\]

since $$f_n(z) = 0$$. Now if we subtract $$f_n(z) = 0$$ from both sides, we see

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) - f_n(z) = n+1 \\]

From Remark 2, we also know

\\[ f_{n+1}(z) - f_n(z) = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots + z^n \\]

Thus

\\[ n+1 = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots + z^n \\]

which, by Remark 3, implies that $$z = 1$$. But this is a contradiction, since $$f_n(1) \neq 0$$. $$\square$$
